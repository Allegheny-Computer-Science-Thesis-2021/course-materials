This course relies heavily on the above platforms. Your work will be assigned and evaluated on and crucial communication distributed through them. You are expected to register for and remain active on these platforms throughout the academic year.

##### Email policy

Despite the fact that the majority of our communication relies on our [Slack](https://cs-senior-thesis-2021.slack.com) and other platforms, the faculty may occasionally use email to communicate significant information. As with other course platforms, it is your responsibility to be accoutable for email communication.

### Learning outcomes

By the end of this series of courses, you will develop skills to:

* Develop and complete an independent research process
* Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media via proposal and oral defenses
* Describe and analyze a research process, its methods, and outcomes in the form of a formal thesis document
* Effectively accomplish and offer peer and metacritical review

### Grading policies

Faculty in the Department of Computer Science evaluate individual student performance as a faculty body, discussing submitted student deliverables. These deliverables are scored using the following percentages:

|Letter grade | Range      |
|:------------|:-----------|
|A            | 96 - 100   |
|A-           | 90 - 95.9  |
|B+           | 87 - 89.9  |
|B            | 83 - 86.9  |
|B-           | 80 - 82.9  |
|C+           | 77 - 79.9  |
|C            | 73 - 76.9  |
|C-           | 70 - 72.9  |
|D+           | 67 - 69.9  |
|D            | 63 - 66.9  |
|D-           | 60 - 62.9  |
|F            | 59.9 and below |

#### Class participation

As written, all students are required to attend all of the Monday class sessions and to fully participate in their research group meetings. Additionally, this also requires regular contributions, in the form of peer editing, questions and comments. For additional meetings with First or Second Reader(s), [make an appointment via reader office hours](#Readers).

#### Course repositories

You are responsible for accepting and maintaining GitHub repositories for each of the assigned course projects. These assignments will be issued in the course [Slack channel](https://cs-senior-thesis-2021.slack.com). Repositories include completion- and submission-specific instructions via `README` files. Many of these operations feature using GitHub's tagging mechanism to release PDFs of your proposal with versions that adhere to the course's semantic versioning standard. 

**Course instructors will only grade and provide feedback on projects that are stored and properly released through GitHub.**

##### Status updates

This assignment types asks you to detail the progress made on identifying a topic for your project and completing the preliminary research needed to demonstrate its feasibility. This work should account for feedback solicited from your First and Second Readers.

##### Thesis proposal

The thesis proposal process is characterized by two fundamental parts.

###### Proposal document


Subject to multiple rounds of extensive revision, this technical document must be formatted according to the Departments thesis proposal style requirements and approved for a subsequent defense by your First Reader. Guidelines for style and individual document requirements will be provided at the time of assignment.

###### Proposal defenses

An oral defense of your proposal documentation to be held at a faculty-scheduled time. The first reader reserves the right to cancel students proposal defense if the thesis proposal document does not meet minimum requirements outlined below. Projects subject to this condition may require a follow-up defense.

##### Thesis chapters

A submission of any two draft chapters of your thesis document. Written in a professional and scientific style, these chapters must be formatted in the Department's thesis style. _Note that this style is different from the proposal style; guidelines for this style will be provided along with the thesis chapter assignment issued this semester_.

### Syllabus revision policy

The faculty of the Department of Computer Science reserve the right to make changes to this syllabus document. Should a change occur, changes may be discussed with the members of the course community. Minor revisions to wording that do not impact course events or deliverables may be made without notice. 

Any change which impacts dates or significant changes in student responsibility will be communicated -- in writing -- at least one week in advance of due date of the deliverable affected.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone elseâ€™s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. The faculty encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from their First Readers. To meet with readers, consult [available office hours and make an appointment](#Readers).

Historically, students who are successful in department courses visit and discuss course concepts with the instructor and early and often.

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let us know immediately -- **full stop**.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

Part of our role as course instructors is to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances of the on-going global pandemic.
