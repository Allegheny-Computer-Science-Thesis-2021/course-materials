## Syllabus

### Course description

Independent research in computer science. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Must be taken on the letter-grade basis. 

* Prerequisite: `CMPSC 600`
* Distribution Requirements: `None`

### Welcome

This continuation of the thesis process asks much of you: implementation, writing, and cohesive defense of the processes and methods proposed in the previous semester. Given the sustained nature of the work required to marshall the sum of your efforts, the tasks in front of you may seem insurmountable. It is the hope of the Faculty that the structure of this course will facilitate progress and reduce the necessary time pressure that an impending due date imposes. For many students, this more practical and concrete phase of the thesis is often the most exciting, though it can--undoubtedly--surface new and challenging issues.

We hope that you bring the same level of zeal and commitment to this work. Your dedication and discipline in the closing stages of the thesis project will lead to proportional reward.

#### Note about assignments

To pass `CMPSC 610`, submissions of and participation in the following assignments are _required_:

* At least one (1) episode of an ethics podcast recorded with a faculty interviewer ([see assignment description below](#Ethics-podcast))
* Complete thesis chapters and implementation ("Thesis Project")
* Thesis Project defense

Failure to successfully complete any of the above requirements will constitute a failing grade in the course.

#### Class participation

As written, all students are required to attend all of the Monday class sessions and to fully participate in their research group meetings. Additionally, this also requires regular contributions, in the form of peer editing, questions and comments. For additional meetings with First or Second Reader(s), [make an appointment via reader office hours](#Readers).

#### Course repositories

You are responsible for accepting and maintaining GitHub repositories for each of the assigned course projects. These assignments will be issued in the course [Slack channel](https://cs-senior-thesis-2021.slack.com). Repositories include completion- and submission-specific instructions via `README` files. Many of these operations feature using GitHub's tagging mechanism to release PDFs of your proposal with versions that adhere to the course's semantic versioning standard. 

**Course instructors will only grade and provide feedback on projects that are stored and properly released through GitHub.**

##### Status updates and peer review

This assignment types asks you to detail progress made in the course of implementing, evaluating, and assessing your work. This work should account for feedback solicited from your First and Second Readers. 

In addition, you will be requested (at four points throughout the semester) to complete peer reviews of draft documents. This feedback is crucial to you and your peers' progress in this course. `CMPSC 610` features:

* peer review of remainig these chapter outline(s)
* peer review of the third thesis chapter
* peer review of the fourth thesis chapter
* peer review of entire thesis document

##### Thesis project

The thesis proposal process is characterized by three fundamental parts.

###### Thesis project implementation

Implementation of the thesis project must be made available to your reader(s) via GitHub. For theoretical or abstract projects which _cannot_ be implemented in functional code, this requirement may be substituted or waived on a per-project basis.

###### Thesis document

Subject to multiple rounds of extensive revision, this technical document must be formatted according to the Department's thesis proposal style requirements and approved for a subsequent defense by your First Reader. 

Basic features of thesis document are listed in the [course guidelines](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#proposal-document).

###### Thesis defenses

An oral defense of your thesis document and implementation to be held at a faculty-scheduled time. The first reader reserves the right to cancel students  defense if the thesis document does not meet minimum requirements outlined in [course guidelines](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#proposal-defenses). Projects subject to this condition may require a follow-up defense.

###### Ethics podcast

Each student is required to record at least one (1) episode of a `10` - `20` minute podcast recorded with a Faculty member. This episode is organized around ethical and other related issues implied by your thesis project. 

These episodes will take the form of an interview. They should be conducted _by `10 May`_. Prof. Luman will contact you to schedule this (though may not be your interviewer).

### Syllabus revision policy

The faculty of the Department of Computer Science reserve the right to make changes to this syllabus document. Should a change occur, changes may be discussed with the members of the course community. Minor revisions to wording that do not impact course events or deliverables may be made without notice. 

Any change which impacts dates or significant changes in student responsibility will be communicated -- in writing -- at least one week in advance of due date of the deliverable affected.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. The faculty encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from their First Readers. To meet with readers, consult [available office hours and make an appointment](#Readers).

Historically, students who are successful in department courses visit and discuss course procesess and assignments early and often.

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let us know immediately -- **full stop**.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

Part of our role as course instructors is to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let us know if there is anything we can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances of the on-going global pandemic. Again, let us remind and encourage you -- _**it is part of our job**_ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.
